#### I am the steward of websites

A steward ensures the comfort, safety, and satisfaction of passengers and crew through a range of hospitality and housekeeping services. 

#### What I do

Make community websites work. Usually legacy systems that have customized original software beyond recognition.

#### Why I'm here

To generate income for software as a service. To learn from my betters. To leave a my work for others to continue when I am gone. Yes, I am old.

#### Coding philosophy

Messy code is working code. Every hacky-looking line was put there to solve a real-world problem for an anxious customer.

Coders who don't comment are coders who have not yet maintained systems for long periods of time. As in decades.

#### Current tools

PHP, Vue, SQL, Javascript
